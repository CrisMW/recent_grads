# How are recent grads doing?
## Visualizing the outcomes of recent grads
----------------
The data I'll be exploring here focuses on recent grads in the US surveyed between 2010-2012. It contains information such as the median salary, unemployment rate, the ratio of men:women etc. for grads in different majors.

I'll be using this data to answer questions about things that could affect the unemployment rates and salaries of different majors. Amongst other things, I'll be looking at how popularity of majors affect the unemployment rates of grads, or at how the share of women affects the average salary.
