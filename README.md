# How are recent grads doing?
## Visualizing the outcomes of recent grads
----------------
The data I'll be exploring here focuses on recent grads in the US surveyed between 2010-2012. It contains information about contains information about grads from different majors such as the share of unemployed grads, the ratio of men:women etc.

I'll be using this data to answer questions about the unemployment rates and median salaries of different majors.

For instance, I'll be looking at how the share of women affects the average salaries.
